- Which parts of the product's functionality will be adjustable by the user?
    - Will the blinds closing be triggered by a certain delta or will they be progressively more or less shut relative to light levels?
    - Other settings that should be in the hands of the user?

*No setting should be adjustible by the user necessarily. The sensor will simply send data to the receiver, and the receiver then decides what to do with the data.*

- What constraints do we have with regards to how the product looks? Any specific size, shape, or color?
    - Presumably the ideal color is white, it's most likely to blend in with the house facade, and will absorb the least energy when hit by strong direct sunlight, generating the least heat.

*No requirements towards size/shape, the smaller the better. White is the ideal color.*

- Since the unit needs to generate it's own independent energy, are there any constraints towards the method used to generate this?
    - Solar? Wind? Budget constraints?

*Solar is the optimal choice.*

- Will the energy generated be used by other products?
- What environmental requirements do we have?
    - Since the product presumably will include components containing potentially harmful rare earth metals, such as a lithium-ion battery and a solar cell, will there be requirements towards how this product is disposed of?
    - **Suggestion:** Components that need to be recycled separately should be easily accessible and removable, for example the battery and solar cell should be accessible and removable.
    - Additionally, this is a good thing for servicing the product should components break down prematurely.

*Our suggestion is good and should probably the implemented.* 

- How long is the product expected to function without generating energy?
    - For example, if the product is installed in Kiruna, where the sun doesn't rise for a large part of the winter, how long is the sensor expected to function on it's internal energy buffer before it's acceptable to run out of energy?
    - How should we maximize runtime? Invest in a large battery capacity, shutdown periods, optimizing energy usage etc.

*Energy conservation shouldnâ€™t be a problem. Focus on low-energy components. 2 months is a good ballpark.*
