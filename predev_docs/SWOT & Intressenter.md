# SWOT
| **Strengths** | **Weaknesses** |
| ---------- |-------------- |
| S1 highly motivated team members <br></br> S2 good technical knowledge <br></br> S3 product is built out of established hardware and software <br></br> S4 a large part of the project can be completed from home | W1 group members have never worked together before <br></br> W2 inexperienced in relevant systems |
| **Opportunities** | **Threats** |
| O1 well-established and growing market <br></br> O2 our product fills a hole in the market <br></br> O3 open-source code to help us already exists <br></br> O4 there are several alternative hardware systems we could use in the event of one being unusable | T1 risk of COVID-19 infections complicating work <br></br> T2 product may become more expensive than expected, due to using outsourced products <br></br> T3 problems with supply chains could lead to a lack of components <br></br> T4 a competing company may come out with a similar product before us <br></br> T5 rules around systems and components may block us from making a commercialized product |


| Conclusions and solutions |  | Handled in... |
| --- | --- | --- |
| S1 + S2 + S3 + O3 + W2 | Team members are very motivated to learn more about and develop the project. Hardware being well-established and documented means it should not be very difficult to learn.  | Pre-dev studies |
| S4 + T1 | A large part of the project can be completed from home, meaning in the event of COVID-19 infection the project can progress even without the team meeting in person. | Inter-team communication platforms |
| O4 + T2 + T5 | If we end up with budget issues or problems around terms and conditions barring us from using certain components in a commericalized product there are several alternative systems we can use instead.  | Hardware specification |
| W1 + T3 + T4 |  |  |
