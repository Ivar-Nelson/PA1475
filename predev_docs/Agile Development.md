- Enkelt att hantera tidsmässiga förändringar. 
- En mer fokuserad och självständig fördelning av arbetsprocessen. 
- Regelbunden, mer och enklare kommunikation inom projektgruppen.
- Större frihet i arbetssätt och metoder, och ansvaret för detta placeras snarare på lägre nivåer i hierarkin. 
- Regelbunden kommunikation med kunden.

We may not be able to deliver functioning, i.e. *valuable* software at the end of *every* sprint, because we're still not clear on exactly what *functioning* entails. As we have further meetings with the customer, this will probably be made clear, but as of now our assumption is that we won't reach a level that could be considered an MVP until the end of our second or third sprint at the earliest. Hence, the first principle may not be followed. 

We also are set in our deadline in terms of when we need to deliver *something*, and as such technical excellence over good design won't be our priority. For example, if we fall victim to supply shortages of components (at the moment our general plan is to use a Raspberry Pi), and we won't be able to have components to work with until April, we'll instead focus on alternative options to be able to deliver *something*. An agile team striving for technical excellence would probably instead push the deadline forward and wait for the late delivery of their components.
